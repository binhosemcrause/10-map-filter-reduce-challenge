## Description
Map: Transforms an array by applying a function to each element, returning a new array with the same length as the original.

Filter: Filters an array based on a condition provided by a function, returning a new array with only elements that satisfy the condition.

Reduce: Reduces an array to a single value by applying a function that accumulates the result, starting from an initial value and iterating through the array.

These methods make array manipulation easier and are commonly used in JavaScript.
